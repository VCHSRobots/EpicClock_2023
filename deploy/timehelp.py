# These fuctions deal with handling time in the micropython format.
# The 8-tuple format for time is: (year, month, date, hour, minute, second, dow, doy),
# where dow stands for day-of-week, and doy stands for day-of-year.
#
# Note that the 8-tuple does not carry information regarding timezone.
#
# Day-of-year is not used.  However, Day-of-week (dow) is used.  Monday is defined by
# micropython to be zero, so we must stick with that.
